# AI Puzzle MVP — Progress Update (Feb 7)

## The Product

Animated kids' puzzles made from customer photos — think Pixar-style cartoon, not photorealistic. That's a deliberate choice: cartoon art is more fun for kids, more forgiving across different photos, and stands out from competitors doing basic photo puzzles.

## How the AI Works (settled after testing 7+ models)

- We use two AI models in sequence: one transforms the photo into a cartoon character (~$0.04), then a second fixes the face to actually look like the person (~$0.003). Total cost per image is about 4.5 cents and takes ~45 seconds.
- We tested many alternatives before landing here. Some couldn't preserve hair. Some made faces too generic. Some were too slow or too expensive. This combo gets the best balance of likeness, style, and cost.

## Quality Scoring — Redesigned for Cartoon Art

- We score every result 0-100. Biggest factor (40%) is whether the face still looks like the person. The rest measures things like colour vibrancy, clean lines, and resolution — all tuned for cartoon art specifically. We originally scored for photorealism, which was penalising the cartoon style we actually want.
- Target is 80+ before we list on Etsy. Currently around 70 — close but not consistent enough yet.

## What We Built Today

A working web app where you can upload a photo, pick a puzzle style, and see the AI-generated cartoon result — all from your browser. No command line needed anymore.

**What you can do with it:**

- Upload a photo and choose from 4 cartoon styles
- Watch progress in real time as the AI works
- See the original photo side-by-side with the cartoon version
- Rate results and leave feedback (stored in a database)
- Download a preview image

## It's Live Online

Deployed to free hosting so either of us can test it from anywhere. It runs a lighter version (no print-quality export) to keep hosting costs at zero for now. Full quality pipeline still runs locally.

## Key Decisions Made

- Removed the "subject" field from the upload form — it wasn't adding value
- Terms & conditions shown before upload so we're covered legally
- Free hosting is good enough for internal testing; we'll upgrade for customers

## What's Next

- Get quality scores consistently above 80/100
- Test with a wider variety of faces (different ages, skin tones, hair types)
- Fine-tune the cartoon style prompts
