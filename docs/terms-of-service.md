# Terms of Service

**Last updated: February 2026**

## 1. Service Description

We create personalized jigsaw puzzles featuring AI-generated fantasy character versions of photos you provide. By placing an order, you agree to these terms.

## 2. Photo Submission & License

- By submitting a photo, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to process the image using AI tools solely for the purpose of creating your custom puzzle.
- You represent that you have the right to submit the photo (it's yours, or you have consent from the person depicted).
- We do not resell, redistribute, or use your photos for any purpose other than fulfilling your order.

## 3. Consent Requirements

- You must be 18 years or older to place an order, OR have parental/guardian consent.
- If the photo depicts a minor, the ordering adult confirms they are the parent/legal guardian or have explicit consent from the parent/legal guardian.
- By completing your order, you affirm that all depicted persons (or their guardians) consent to the AI transformation of their likeness.

## 4. AI Processing

- Photos are processed through third-party AI services (currently Replicate/various AI models).
- AI outputs are artistic interpretations and may not perfectly represent the original photo.
- We make reasonable efforts to preserve facial identity but cannot guarantee exact likeness.

## 5. Data Retention

- Customer photos are retained for a maximum of **30 days** after order completion.
- After 30 days, photos and AI-generated intermediates are permanently deleted.
- Final product images (the puzzle design) may be retained for order records.

## 6. Refund Policy

- If the AI transformation is unrecognizable or unsatisfactory, we will regenerate with different settings at no additional cost (up to 2 regenerations).
- If after regeneration you are still unsatisfied, we offer a full refund before printing.
- Once a puzzle has been sent to print, refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis.

## 7. Intellectual Property

- The AI-generated artwork is created for your personal, non-commercial use.
- You may not resell, commercially redistribute, or mass-produce the generated designs.
- You receive a personal-use license for the final puzzle product.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

- We are not responsible for delays caused by print suppliers or shipping carriers.
- Our liability is limited to the purchase price of the puzzle.

## 9. Changes to Terms

We may update these terms. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
